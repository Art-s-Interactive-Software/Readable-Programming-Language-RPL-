# Readable Programming Language (RPL)
An interpreted programming language written entirely in Python, that focuses on making programming easy and understandable, like you're talking with the computer. Anyone who has a computer and who knows english can use this programming language.

Here are its features:

# Printing and Displaying:
say 'Hello, World!'- Prints a value and then asks you if you want to name it or not. For example: 'say 'Hello, World!''. show print value of (name of print value) - Prints the value of the print you have saved. For example: 'show print value of greeting' and let's say it prints 'Hello!'. show variable (name of the variable) - Prints the value of the variable. For example: 'show variable a' and let's say it prints 'Hey!'.

# Math and Calculations:
calculate variables: - Calculates the value of the existing variables. You will be asked to write two variables and in between them, you need to write an operation. For example: 'a + b'. calculate inputs: - Calculates the value of the existing inputs. You will be asked to write two inputs and in between them, you need to write an operation. For example: 'a + b'.
add: - Adds two numbers. You will be asked to write the first number and the second number. subtract: - Subtracts two numbers. You will be asked to write the first number and the second number. multiply: - Multiplies two numbers. You will be asked to write the first number and the second number. divide: - Divides two numbers. You will be asked to write the first number and the second number. power: - You will be asked to write the first number and the second number. Something like this: first number in the power of second number that you have written.

# Control Flow:
forever: - It creates a forever loop. To exit, you can type 'stop'. For example: in the forever loop, when you write 'say 'Hello!'', it will print 'Hello!' forever, until you close the program. repeat: - It repeats a letter or word how many times you want. You will be asked what kind of string to repeat and how many times to repeat. repeat variable: - It repeats an existing variable how many times you want. You will be asked to type the name of the variable and how many times to print that variable. if: - It creates a if statement. You will be asked to type a variable, an expression, a value and the condition where you can type a line of code. If the condition is True, it will execute the code, but if it's false, it will not execute the code.

# Functionality:
create a variable: - Creates a new variable. You will be asked about the name of the variable and its value. create a function: - It creates a new function and you will be asked to type the name of the function. Then you can type some code inside that function forever, until you type 'end the function'. To run the function, you type: 'run (name of the function)'. create a new file: - Creates a new file and you will be asked to write the name of the file, the type of the file and the content of the file. run (name of the file): - It runs a supported file that RPL (READABLE Programming Language) can run. It should contain code that can be run by RPL.

# User interactions:
ask 'Say something: '- It will create a input where you can type a text and then it will ask you if you want to save it or not. For example: input 'Say something: ', it will display 'Say something: ' and you'll be able to type anything you want. show input (name of input) - Prints the saved input. draw rectangle: / triangle: / circle: - Draws the figures that you type. For example: 'draw rectangle:' draws a rectangle.

# REM:
'#' - Makes a comment. Comments are ignored by the program.

# Explanation and Helping:

# WARNING!
This is just the first version of Readable Programming Language (RPL). It may have bugs, because it is still in development

# You Can Contribute Too!
You can contribute by testing Readable Programming Language (RPL) and also by fixing some bugs or issues with the code.
